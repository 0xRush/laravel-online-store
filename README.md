<h1> simple online store api using laravel, </h1>
<p>I have created api with auth to make users make full crud on products,</p> <br>
<p>the other users can add these products to the cart, then they can buy these products by paying the cart.</p><br>

<ul>
<h3>notes:</h3>
<li>there is a collection from postman that you can import it to use the project.</li>
<li>I know there is some issues could happen and alot of functionallity need to be enhanced, but i made this project fast for learning purposes so you have to make these enhancement your self -_-</li>
</ul>
